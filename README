    s2qkd-sim.py:   This interactive program estimates and visualizes 
                    Qubit error rate, classical communication rate
                    and private key rate as a function of the Transmission rate and
                    other parameters.

    input:          Sliders are used to variate the following parameters
                    DC rate     =   Dark Count on Alice or Bob's side per second.
                    Cwin        =   Coincidence window
                    Visibility  =   The visibility of entanglement. (this parameter
                    quantifies the quality of entanglement)
                    EP rate     =   The number of entangled pairs generated from the
                    source per second.   
                   
                    reset       =   On click the sliders are reset to the default 
                     values.
                   
    output:         outputs a QBER.png file containing the default plots.
                   
    Usages:         To use this program run:    python s2qkd-sim.py
