s2qkd-sim.py:   This interactive program estimates and visualizes Qubit error
                rate, classical communication rate and private key rate as a
                function of the Transmission rate and other parameters.

input:          Sliders are used to to variate the following parameters
                Dark count rate                     =   Dark Count on Alice or
                                                         Bob's side per second.

                Entangled pair generation rate      =   The number of entangled

                                                        are reset to the
                                                        default values.
               
output:         outputs a QBER.png file containing the default plots.
               
Usages:         To use this program run:    python s2qkd-sim.py

Prerequisites:  This program is tested for python2.7
                You need the following libraries
              
                matplotlib
